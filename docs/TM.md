﻿﻿#TM.java can execute the following abilities   1.  Log the time that work began on a particular task. Use "Java TM Start <task name>"  2. Log the time that work stopped on a particular task.  Use "Java TM Stop <task name>"  3. Record a description for a particular task.  Use "Java TM Describe <task name>"  4. Provide a summary of the time spent on a particular task.  Use "Java TM Summary <task name>"  5. Provide a  summary report for all tasks.  Use "Java TM Summary"  6. Logging the size of a task is now possible. Use "Java TM <task name>". #Design Choices 1. The program stores the data as a text file title "tm.txt"2. It is formatted as <Date> <Time> <task> 3. Descriptions of each task are stored separately from the start and stop entries4. Summary <task> returns any line of "tm.txt" which contains the word entered for <task>5. Summary returns the entirety of "tm.txt"  6. Size <task> will add a size description to the individual task input. #Limitations, Concerns and Solutions1. Because data is stored in "tm.txt", The file should be renamed when it is sent to the manager * Renaming the file will make organization easier for the person viewing multiple different employee files2. Because descriptions are logged separately, multiple description entries may clutter the "tm.txt" in the long term * Employees entering descriptions should be mindful of their entries and only enter one description per task 3. Because "Summary <task name>" returns all entries containing <task name>, there is a potential return unwanted entries  * Employees should refrain from using other task names in their descriptions of tasks * Managers should be aware of this when reading the data to ensure they do not record irrelevant entries 4. Because "Summary" returns all entries in "tm.txt", calculation of the total time spent on one task must be deduced from reading the file  * Managers should ensure that each start and stop time pertains to the correct task  * Employees should ensure that they stop the task they are working on before they start a new one, this will make reading the summary easier 5. Because the data is stored in a text file, employees may attempt to alter their file  * "tm.txt" should be password protected  so that employees may not access the "tm.txt" file without the password  * If an employee already has a file named "tm.txt" on their computer, data will be appended to the files existing data6. Size description may be entered multiple times and thus recorded multiple times * This could be useful for future projects * As size of a task evolves the information may become useful data itself #Reasons For Design Choices  1. Each design choice was made to lower the total cost of designing the program  2. The decision for the formatting and use of the text file allows for the use of other programs to use the data from the text file for other reasons  3. Summaries are shown in a particular format that will make it easier for other programs to read if needed  4. The design of this program assumes that each employee will enter their start and stop time on their own separate computers  5. The design of this program assumes that managers will receive multiple "tm.txt" files from multiple employees, and organize the files as needed 6. Multiple descriptions entries should not be an issue, as the evolving description may be useful to future employees assigned to a similar task  7. Design choices are acceptable at this time, as improvement beyond this would have yielded only incremental benefits at much higher costs.
